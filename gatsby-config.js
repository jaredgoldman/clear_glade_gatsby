        //
        // By implementing a `filterNode(node): boolean` function, you can choose to eliminate some nodes before
        // they're added to Gatsby, the default behaviour is to include all nodes:
        filterNode: () => true,
    
        // By implementing a `mapNode(node): node` function, you can provide your own node transformations directly
        // during node sourcing, the default implementation is to return the node as is:
        mapNode: node => node
      }
